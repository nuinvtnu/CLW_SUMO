CLW-SUMO: A Hybird Deep Learning Model for predicting Protein SUMOylation sites.

In this study, we propose a novel approach, called CLW-SUMO, for predicting SUMOylation sites using a hybrid deep learning model that combines convolutional neural networks (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM), using Word2Vec as the word embedding technique.
